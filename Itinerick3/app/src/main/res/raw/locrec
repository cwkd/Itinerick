    "keyword": "hawpar",
    "description": "Built in 1937, Haw Par Villa is famous for its often gruesome depictions of Chinese folklore's 10 Courts of Hell.

Pick your favourite from the over 1,000 colourful statues and tableaux on display, among them a giant gorilla and massive deity heads."},

No matter where your imagination takes you, the Marina Bay Sands SkyPark is a gawk-worthy feat of engineering. Designed by visionary architect Moshe Safdie, the SkyPark floats atop the three soaring Marina Bay Sands hotel towers. It houses a ticketed observation deck, lush gardens, top-notch restaurants and an exclusive, infinity-edge swimming pool with a legendary view."},
  { "name": "Merlion",
    "keyword": "merlion",
    "description": "By now, you should have realized that merlion = mermaid + lion. There are five authorised merlion statues around Singapore today. The body symbolises Singapore's humble beginnings as a fishing village when it was called Temasek, meaning 'sea town' in Old Javanese. Its head represents Singapore's original name, Singapura, or 'lion city' in Malay. Today, you can glimpse this legend at Merlion Park, spouting water from its mouth."},

Opened in 1994 and located next to the Singapore Zoo, the Night Safari is the world’s first safari park for nocturnal animals. But it resembles a wildlife park more than an actual safari. Your eyes will take a while to adjust to the darkness here, but once they do, you’ll be greeted by over 2,500 resident animals from over 130 species."},
  { "name": "Umbrella Trees",
    "keyword": "umbrella",
    "description": "Ever wished for someone to hold up an umbrella to shade you from the hot sun in Singapore? The Hindoo Road site features tree sculptures, but with their leaves replaced by umbrellas to shade the seating areas beneath.
